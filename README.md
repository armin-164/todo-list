# todo-list

This project is a ToDo List web application that I am building to practice my web development skills, particularly my abilities in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. By building this project, I aim to improve my understanding of web development fundamentals, such as DOM manipulation, event handling, and local storage.

In addition, I aim to improve my skills in structuring code, organizing files, and writing clean and maintainable code.

Overall, this project is an opportunity for me to practice my skills and build a functional web application that can be used for personal productivity.
